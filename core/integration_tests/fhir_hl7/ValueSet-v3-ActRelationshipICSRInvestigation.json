The state of the target act being replaced becomes obselete, but the act is typically still retained in the system for historical reference. The source and target must be of the same type.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SEQL\">SEQL</a></td><td>is sequel</td><td>An act relationship indicating that the source act follows the target act. The source act should in principle represent the same kind of act as the target. Source and target need not have the same mood code (mood will often differ). The target of a sequel is called antecedent. Examples for sequel relationships are: revision, transformation, derivation from a prototype (as a specialization is a derivation of a generalization), followup, realization, instantiation.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SPRT\">SPRT</a></td><td>has support</td><td>Used to indicate that an existing service is suggesting evidence for a new observation. The assumption of support is attributed to the same actor who asserts the observation. Source must be an observation, target may be any service (e.g., to indicate a status post).</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>"},"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActRelationshipICSRInvestigation","identifier":[{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.20353"}],"version":"2.0.0","name":"ActRelationshipICSRInvestigation","title":"ActRelationshipICSRInvestigation","status":"active","date":"2014-03-26","description":"**Description:** The ways that product safety Investigations, about which information is captured in an Individual Case Safety Report, are related to each other.
