The priorityNumber attribute is used to weigh refinements as preferred over other alternative refinements.\r\n\r\nExample: several routing options for a drug are specified as one SubstanceAdministration for the general treatment with attached refinements for the various routing options.","immutable":true,"compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActRelationshipType","filter":[{"property":"concept","op":"is-a","value":"OPTN"}]}]}}
