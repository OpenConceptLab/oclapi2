# Contributing to OCLAPI2

## Code Review & Acceptance Process
 - All contributions require code review. For now, our process is simple: Open a [Pull Request on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and ensure pylint and all tests pass on your local setup. One of the responsible code owners will then review your contribution.
